# RedfinDataScienceProject2

Developed an XGBoost-based regression model to predict the sold prices of single-family residences using real estate data. The model leverages key property features—including square footage, lot size, year built, water views, in-ground pools, and geolocation—to uncover pricing patterns and deliver data-driven valuation insights. The workflow includes feature engineering, model training, performance evaluation with MAE, and visualization of feature importance.
